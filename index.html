        <h2>About Johan</h2>

        <p>
          I am an autodidact software and data engineer who loves turning
          ambiguous problems into practical, human-centered systems. With 15+
          years of experience I spot inefficiencies in processes very quickly. I
          use LLMs to accelerate development, but never at the expense of
          clarity, reliability, or ethics.
        </p>

        <p>
          I work remotely, Europe-focused but global clients welcome.
