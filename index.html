          Resolve helps SMBs use large language models to save time and money
          without replacing people. We partner from roadmap to rollout,
          prototype rapidly and build production systems with your team. Our
          approach is:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Human-centered</strong>
            We don't aim to replace people, but amplify their capabilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Flexible</strong>
            We meet you where you are, using the tools you already use
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Transparent</strong>
            People understand and control the technology
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>We resolve</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Bottlenecks</strong>
            Those specific points where work gets stuck or slowed down
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Repetitive drain</strong>
            Tasks that exhaust people without adding value
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Information silos</strong>
            When knowledge is trapped and hard to access
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Decision delays</strong>
            When people wait for data or approvals that could be automated
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scaling friction</strong>
            When growth creates operational chaos
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tool complexity</strong>
            When systems make work harder instead of easier
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Resource limitations</strong>
            Doing more with the same team size
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Knowledge gaps</strong>
            When expertise is needed but not available
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Workflow confusion</strong>
            When processes are unclear or inconsistent
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Communication overhead</strong>
            When coordination takes more time than the actual work
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each of these friction points costs you time, money, and team morale.
          We help you eliminate them systematically.

          <h3>PoliLoom: structuring politicians' data for investigators</h3>
          <p>Client: OpenSanctions, Role: Data Developer (2025–present)</p>

          <section>
            <h4>The problem</h4>
            <p>
              Assemble and verify structured politician data from
              Wikipedia/Wikidata and the wider web, across languages, ensuring
              provenance, correctness, and scale.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Two-stage extraction pipeline: LLM extracts free-text positions
                → vector search maps to exact Wikidata entities → LLM reconciles
              </li>
              <li>
                Embeddings with SentenceTransformers; pgvector in Postgres for
                fast similarity search
              </li>
              <li>
                FastAPI API and Next.js confirmation GUI for human verification
              </li>
              <li>
                Parallel dump processing: near-linear speedup to 32+ cores;
                1.8TB dump processed in passes
              </li>

            <h4>Impact</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Trust: Clear citations and GUI for verification</li>
              <li>
                Scale: Parallelized, test-backed pipeline; batch DB operations
              </li>
              <li>
                Clarity: From unstructured source documents to structured,
                linkable positions

        <h2>About Johan</h2>
        <p>Makes machines empower humans</p>

        <p>
          I am an autodidact software and data engineer who loves turning
          ambiguous problems into practical, human-centered systems. With 15+
          years of experience I spot inefficiencies in processes very quickly. I
          use LLMs to accelerate development, but never at the expense of
          clarity, reliability, or ethics.
        </p>

        <p>I work remotely, Europe-focused but global clients welcome.</p>
